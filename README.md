# Monkeying-Waves

Welcome! This is project is for Global Game Jam 2017.

Description: Oh no! Someone stole the monkey's life preservers and threw them over the water spouts! The monkeys can’t swim, but they do have a cannon!
Make waves with the cannon to force the life preserves up the spouts. Be careful they don’t fly high up into the air!
